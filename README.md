# RequestServer
Shell interpreter that allows users to submit feature ideas to an SQLite database.

This program was written to be an easier 
way for me to write down feature ideas on 
version controlled projects.
It was developed on a windows machine, 
but I don't see anything obvious in the 
code that would make this program not 
work on other operating systems that 
support the python standard library.
